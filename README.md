## FAQ


#### Do we host Guardian Nodes ?
We encourage you to set up your own Guardian Node by using the tutorials on this page. <br>
But also offer Gurdian Node hosting if you want to. This is free while we are in beta. Please contact us on discord for more info: https://discord.gg/SGUtY7zBU3 


#### What is different between Thetaboard and Gpool?


In our architecture, everyone has their own Guardian Node. <br>
Which is better for a couple of reason:  We are not a "man in the middle" between you and your GN. 
So you get rewards right away, and you get full control over your Guardian Node. <br>
It is also better for theta network health in general as more GN the better. <br>
Last point, on top of the Guardian Node we also provide a cool dashboard that allow you to track price, 
get chart about your wallet, history of your transactions, forecasting of Tfuel rewards, and a lot of other valuable information for any theta holder.
