# Thetaboard
You are trying to set up your own guardian node for Theta ? You want an easy-to-use web interface to manage it ?
You want a 360Â° view of you wallet, transactions, holdings, staking 

You came to the right place ! Thetaboard was made to easily set up a theta guardian node on your laptop or on the cloud.
It can also be used to get information about Theta and your wallet.<br>
<br> 

### Features
An easy-to-use Docker container for installing &amp; running a Theta guardian node.
It is provided with a webserver with the following features:
 - Linked to your theta wallet
 - Show your theta and t-fuels holdings
 - Beautiful graphs to tracks your favorite metrics
 - Stake your theta to your Guardian Node in one click
 - Start/Stop your Guardian Node
 - Update your Guardian Node to the latest version

 - *COMING SOON*: Stake your tfuel on your edge node using this interface as well ( we are waiting on mainet 3.0 + some API's from theta's team)
 
We don't and will never track any data about anything at all.
